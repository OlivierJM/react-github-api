`react-github-api` uses GraphQL with github API to search for a user and show their repositories instantly.  
I used debounce to avoid making too much calls to the GraphQL server each on each onChange on the input field.

## How to use it

Just put in your username or any other username you want to look for and it will show you the repositories.

# Development

## requirements

- Node Ë†v6
- npm@latest

after that clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/OlivierJM/react-github-api.git`  
`cd react-github-api`

install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn`

you will need a github token for this to work, generate one for yourself [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)

create a file in the root of the project called `.env` and add your token as follows.

`REACT_APP_TOKEN="YOURTOKENSHOULDBEHERE1234"`

## Running

`npm start` or `yarn start`

# Testing

`npm run test`
